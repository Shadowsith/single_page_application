# Single page application

This is a demo project how to realize rooting on a single page website only with HTML5, PHP, JavaScript and Bootstrap + jQuery frameworks

## Motivation

Webspace users with a domain have mostly no choice to use a web framework like Ruby on Rails, Angular etc. and for them
it could be very interesting how to load and unload content with AJAX and PHP. 

## Dependencies

I generally recommand the jQuery and Bootstrap frameworks for working on simple web applications
